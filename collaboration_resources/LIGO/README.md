  * article on family-friendly policies: "men who work in a department where it is easy to adjust work schedules to care for family report significantly more publications and lower teaching loads, indicating that for men, a flexible work environment is increasing workâ€“family balance and contributing to productivity. In comparison, there is no significant relationship between perceived department flexibility and work outcomes for women."
